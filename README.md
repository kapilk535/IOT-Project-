# IOT-Project-
Practice Project of IOT to be done under supervision of Robotics Lab UIET


## Project Objective
To get weather forcast data and send to users on E-Mail and SMS and also add data to Google Scripts and Our local IOT Server And Also further display the data on LCD.
  
## Project Materials Used
- NodeMCU ESP8266 (12E) Board
- Any Weather forcast data Source
- Google Scripts
- LCD 
- Any Device for Programming NodeMCU
- USB Cable for NodeMCU


## Project Starting Date
    24/06/19
        
        
## Project Deadline
    15/07/19
    
    
## Project TimeLine
- **Week 1 [24/06/19 to 30/06/19]**
    To Learn Basics and Intermediate Level of Google Script and try out basic Interfacing Projects using NodeMCU and Google Script.  
- **Week 2 [01/07/19 to 07/07/19]** 
    To Implement the learned Knowledge of Google Script and apply it to get the Data from a weather forcast data site to an Email Address and SMS and also store the data in our local server of NodeMCU.            
- **Week 3 [08/07/19 to 14/07/19]**
    To implement the data delivery on Email and SMS at given time of the day and Display the data to an LCD attached to our NodeMCU.            

## Project Progress
- **Till date 02/07/19**
    Learned about Google script and it's basic coding to get data in sheets.
    Also working on API to use for weather forecast data (Using OpenWeather)
    Will Try publishing it's data to Google Sheets using NodeMCU and will upload code soon.
- **Till date 04/07/19**
    Sent Weather Data using Google Sheets and Script to Any Email.Code Also Uploaded.
- **Till date 06/07/19**
    Made NodeMCU Code for working it as a internet data Weather Station.
